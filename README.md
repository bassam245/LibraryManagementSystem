 Library Management System

A simple C# console application to manage a small library.  
This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, custom data structures, and manual algorithm implementations such as insertion sort and binary search.

 Features : 

- Add and manage books and members
- Borrow and return books
- Sort books by ID using manual Insertion Sort
- Search for a book by ID using Binary Search
- Custom generic list implementation (Listt<T>)

Technologies : 

- C#
- .NET Console Application

 Project Structure : 

- Models: Book, Member, and Person classes
- DataStructures: Contains Listt<T>
- Algorithms: InsertionSort and BinarySearch logic
- Services: Contains main library logic in Mangeliprary.cs
- Program.cs: The main entry point to run and test the system

 How It Works : 

- Books are added manually in Program.cs
- Members can borrow or return books
- Book list is displayed before and after sorting
- System checks whether a book exists and shows its position

 Output Example :

 Notes : 

- All lists and algorithms are implemented manually (no built-in collections)
- This project focuses on understanding the logic behind data structures and OOP
